# the purpose of this script is to identify how many journals included in our sample are already included in TOP-d
# this is note in the sample data files. The code then extracts and saves the relevant data from TOP-d

highImpactSample <- read_csv(here('data','primary','prepareSamples','highImpactSample.csv'))

# one problem we need to overcome is that the journal names used in the top database do not follow the same formatting standards as in the WOS database
# one change we can make to improve standardisation is to make the journal names in the top database uppercase (as they are in the samples)
top <- top %>%
  mutate(Journal = toupper(Journal))

# Now we will use approximate string matching to see if journal names in the sample are a close match to ones in the TOP database
# Specifically, we will compute the Standard Levenshtein distance (SLD)

sampleJournals <- tibble(journals = c(randomSample$Journal, highImpactSample$Journal), # get list of all journals in samples
                         matchInTOP = NA)

# this code will loop through all of the journals in the sample. For each journal, it will compute the SLD against all journal names in
# TOP-d. It will then select any journal names in TOP-d that had an SLD < = 5, display them at the command line, and ask the user to 
# confirm if there is a match or not

# NB - the code below requires MANUAL INPUT so it is commented out. Instead we load the csv file that orginally result from this manually input process
