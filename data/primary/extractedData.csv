The British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology recognizes the many benefits of archiving data for scientific progress. Archived data provides an indispensable resource for the scientific community, making possible future replications and secondary analyses, in addition to the importance of verifying the dependability of published research findings.

The journal expects that where possible all data supporting the results in papers published are archived in an appropriate public archive offering open access and guaranteed preservation. The archived data must allow each result in the published paper to be recreated and the analyses reported in the paper to be replicated in full to support the conclusions made.  Authors are welcome to archive more than this, but not less.

All papers need to be supported by a data archiving statement and the data set must be cited in the Methods section. The paper must include a link to the repository in order that the statement can be published.

It is not necessary to make data publicly available at the point of submission, but an active link must be included in the final accepted manuscript. For authors who have pre-registered studies, please use the Registered Report link in the Author Guidelines.

In some cases, despite the authors’ best efforts, some or all data or materials cannot be shared for legal or ethical reasons, including issues of author consent, third party rights, institutional or national regulations or laws, or the nature of data gathered. In such cases, authors must inform the editors at the time of submission. It is understood that in some cases access will be provided under restrictions to protect confidential or proprietary information. Editors may grant exceptions to data access requirements provided authors explain the restrictions on the data set and how they preclude public access, and, if possible, describe the steps others should follow to gain access to the data.

If the authors cannot or do not intend to make the data publicly available, a statement to this effect, along with the reasons that the data is not shared, must be included in the manuscript.","0. Code sharing is encouraged, or not mentioned.","Supporting Information

Behavioral Interventions recognizes the many benefits of archiving research data. The journal expects you to archive all the data from which your published results are derived in a public repository. The repository that you choose should offer you guaranteed preservation (see the registry of research data repositories at https://www.re3data.org/) and should help you make it findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-useable, according to FAIR Data Principles (https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples).

All accepted manuscripts are required to publish a data availability statement to confirm the presence or absence of shared data. If you have shared data, this statement will describe how the data can be accessed, and include a persistent identifier (e.g., a DOI for the data, or an accession number) from the repository where you shared the data. Authors will be required to confirm adherence to the policy.  If you cannot share the data described in your manuscript, for example for legal or ethical reasons, or do not intend to share the data then you must provide the appropriate data availability statement. The journal notes that FAIR data sharing allows for access to shared data under restrictions (e.g., to protect confidential or proprietary information) but notes that the FAIR principles encourage you to share data in ways that are as open as possible (but that can be as closed as necessary).","0.

This format eliminates the bias against negative results and the questionable practices it often generates, such as selective reporting of results, presenting exploratory analyses as confirmatory, etc. A general overview of Registered Reports can be found here at the Centre for Open Science site: https://cos.io/rr/.

In partnership with the non-profit Center for Open Science (COS), Topics in Cognitive Science awards all qualifying authors open science badges recognizing their contributions to the open science movement. The open science practices and associated award badges, as implemented by the Center for Open Science and supported by Topics in Cognitive Science, are the following:

The Open Materials badge recognizes researchers who share their research materials and instruments (including computational cognitive models) in a publicly-accessible format, providing sufficient information for researchers to reproduce procedures and analyses of published research studies. In the field of cognitive science research, a qualifying public, open-access database of research instruments and materials is Open Science Framework repository. Note that in the case of source code for computational cognitive models it is recognized that dependencies (e.g., specific operating systems, specific versions of libraries and compilers) will exist. These must be clearly documented within the source code in order to qualify for the Open Materials badge.

The Open Data badge recognizes researchers who make their data publicly available, providing sufficient description of the data to allow researchers to reproduce research findings of published research studies. An example of a qualifying public, open-access database for data sharing is the Open Science Framework repository. Numerous other data-sharing repositories are available through various Dataverse networks (e.g., http://dataverse.org) and hundreds of other databases available through the Registry of Research Data Repositories (http://www.re3data.org). There are, of course, circumstances in which it is not possible or advisable to share data publicly. For example, there are cases in which sharing participant data could violate confidentiality. In these cases, the authors may wish to provide an explanation of such circumstances in the Alternative Note section of the disclosure form. The information the authors provide will be included in the article’s Open Practices note.

Topics in Cognitive Science does not currently offer the Centre for Open Science’s Preregistered badge, though we may do so in the future. Authors will have an opportunity at the time of manuscript submission and at the time of acceptance to inform themselves of this initiative and to determine whether they wish to participate. Applying and qualifying for open science badges is not a requirement for publishing with Topics in Cognitive Science, but these badges are further incentive for authors to participate in the open science movement and thus to increase the visibility and transparency of their research.

Sexual Abuse encourages open science practices, which includes preregistration of studies, providing open study materials, or providing study data in a public repository. To qualify, preregistration, open materials, and open data should be on a publicly accessible website in a format that is time-stamped, immutable, and permanent.

To recognize these practices, we are introducing Open Science Framework (OSF) badging to articles published in this journal. For more information about these badges, see the OSF Wiki. Badging is not required for submission, peer review, or publication.

Preregistration badges are currently for Registered Reports only. Authors are asked to be mindful of ethical issues, copyright, and feasibility when considering the sharing of materials or data.

If you wish to apply for OSF badging, please ensure you mention this in your cover letter, complete our disclosure form and include it with your submission.",
