Project title: Journal policies related to research transparency and reproducibility in psychology: A cross-sectional assessment of influential journals and randomly-selected journals

This codebook documents two datasets: 

extractedData.csv
topData.csv. 

Each dataset is described in more detail below.

# Dataset 1: extractedData.csv

Description/source: This dataset contains information recorded in a Google Form by the two authors (BAN, TEH) when assessing journal compliance with TOP polices. The dataset has one row per journal.

Columns:

Timestamp = the time and date that the data were recorded in US format (month/day/year)	
Select your initials = initials of coder assigned to this journal	
Enter journal name = name of journal	
Enter society affiliation (if applicable)	= society affiliation of journal
Provide perma.cc link(s) to policy information on journal website = a copy of any relevant policy information on the journals website

The following columns each refer to one of the TOP standards (e.g., "Data citation") and an accompanying quote (e.g., "Data citation justification quote") from the policy information on the journal website that justifies the score given for that standard. 
	
Data citation	
Data citation justification quote	
Data transparency	
Data transparency justification quote	
Analytical code transparency	
Analytical code transparency justification quote	
Materials transparency	
Materials transparency justification quote	
Reporting guidelines	
Reporting guidelines justification quote	
Study preregistration	
Study preregistration justification quote	
Analysis pre-registration	
Analysis pre-registration justification text	
Replication	
Replication justification quote	
Publication bias	
Publication bias justification quote	
Open science badges	
Open science badges justification quote

The final column was used to take notes so the coders could check each other's work and discuss any unusual cases:

# Dataset 2: topData.csv

Description/source: This dataset contains extant data extracted for assessment of journal TOP Factor maintained by the Center for Open Science (https://osf.io/qatkz/). Only journals included in the sampling frame of this study are included in this dataset. The dataset has one row per journal.


Columns:

Journal	= name of journal
Issn = journal's International Standard Serial Number
Publisher = journal's publisher	
Society	= journal's society affiliation (if any)
Author guideline url = link to the author guidelines on journal website

The following columns each refer to one of the TOP standards (e.g., "Data citation score") and an accompanying quote (e.g., "Data citation justification") from the policy information on the journal website that justifies the score given for that standard. 
	
Data citation score	
Data citation justification	
Data transparency score	
Data transparency justification	
Analysis code transparency score	
Analysis code transparency justification	
Materials transparency score	
Materials transparency justification	
Design & analysis reporting guidelines score	
Design & analysis reporting guidelines justification	
Study preregistration score	
Study preregistration justification	
Analysis plan preregistration score	
Analysis plan preregistration justification	
Replication score	
Replication justification	
Registered reports & publication bias score	
Registered reports & publication bias justification	
Open science badges score
Open science badges justification	

The final column is the total of the scores for each standard (i.e., the 'TOP Factor')
